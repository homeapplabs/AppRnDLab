		openness towards preferable contracting model. We fully understand the

	<br>
	<p>General Contracting is one another widely accepted contracting
		model and is primarily practiced where a customer expect a competent
		contractor to take-up not only the construction activities of entire
		structure but also finishes and MEP. In General Contracting, the
		Client assume contractor as a single point responsibility (General
		Contractor) for the entire scope of works on a project at the initial
		award stage itself while allowing him the discretion to award the
		individual specialized work packages at subsequent stages.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Thus, the main works of the project, such as Civil & Structural
		works are awarded to a large contractor with additional responsibility
		of managing all other scope of works such as internal finishes,
		external finishes & façade, roads, landscaping and MEP works such as
		HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing & Sanitary, Fire Alarm, Fire Fighting, BMS,
		Elevators, etc. The specialized vendors for these packages may be
		finalized at subsequent stages solely by the Client (nominated) or may
		be jointly finalized by the Client and the General Contractor. The
		General Contractor is responsible for the proper coordination among
		various package contractors & also with his own scope of works and
		providing on-site facilities to them for smooth execution of the
		project.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The General Contractor is generally paid a coordination fees for
		the above towards his overheads and margin which may be in the form of
		a pre-decided percentage of the value of the specialized work packages
		or as a lump-sum amount. The General Contractor is responsible for the
		completion of the entire scope of works as per project schedule and
		his risk exposure is generally on the entire project value including
		specialized package works.</p>
