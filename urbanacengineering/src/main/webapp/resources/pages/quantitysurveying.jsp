<h2>QUANTITY SURVEYING</h2>
<div>
	<p>We offer a wide range of Quantity Surveying services to the
		Construction industry. Our professionals are highly experienced team
		of Senior Quantity Surveyors who are extremely proficient for
		preparing & authenticating of Civil, Structural, Architectural and MEP
		BOQs for all the buildings and infrastructure projects.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The analytical analysis and benchmark comparisons of building
		costs from feasibility estimates through to the settlement of Final
		Accounts on completed projects, to provide a dependable Quantity
		Surveying service which understands the design and engineering forms
		and functions to accurately predict the out-turn cost with certainty
		and conviction.</p>
	<h3>Feasibility Estimate</h3>
	<p>The analysis of site constraints, natural environment, urban
		planning constraints, cost parameters, program considerations and
		other essential factors prior to the commencement of any project. This
		allows developers to understand the potential out turn costs of the
		proposed development at an early concept stage in order to test
		viability</p>
	<h3>Cost Plan</h3>
	<p>The detailed, measured, analysis of the components of the
		building, fully priced to illustrate the cost of a building in
		sufficient detail to assist with the interrogation of the costs of
		elements of the design to ensure target budgets are maintained. As the
		design develops, the level of detail increases and so the level of
		refinement in pricing improves and enhances in order to meet out turn
		cost certainty.</p>
	<h3>Bill of Quantities</h3>
	<p>A comprehensive document containing a detailed measurement of
		every element and component of the building, laid out in an industry
		accepted structured format that adheres to the prescribed Standard
		Method of Measurement. The document ensures consistency of pricing by
		tenderers, permits a detailed analysis of the prices received, and
		delivers a comprehensive schedule of the rates and prices for the
		project for use during the construction stage of the project for
		interim valuations and variations.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		We are expert on various International Measurement Codes, such as:<b> POMI,
			QMM, SMM7, CESMM3, ARM2, IS 1200, Highway Method etc.</b>
	</p>
	<h3>Value Engineering</h3>
	<p>By value engineering process, we provide alternative proposals
		for a financial perspective in order to facilitate informed decision
		making on different building materials, systems and techniques, with
		the operating cost considerations being compared to capital cost
		expenditure.</p>
	<h3>Cash-flow Forecast</h3>
	<p>The analysis of the rate of expenditure of the cost of a
		development which assists with forecasting the monthly draw-down
		required to fund the project for clients and third party funders.</p>
	<h3>Tender Documents</h3>
	<p>A structured set of documents which lay out the project and
		contractual requirements, entertaining contractors queries and
		comprehensive tender submissions from tenderers.</p>
	<h3>Tender Process Management</h3>
	<p>Manage the flow of information and documents to the tenderers to
		maintain consistency and fairness of the treatment throughout the
		tendering period. This, ensures that all of the tenders received are
		based on the same information thus permitting a fair and robust
		comparison of all the tenders received.</p>
	<h3>Tender Analysis</h3>
	<p>The detailed analysis of the tenders received to compare rates
		and prices, to ensure compliance with the tender documents and to
		enable a direct comparison on a ‘like for like’ basis to permit a true
		and accurate comparison of the prices for carrying out the works. This
		will highlight any ambiguities or inconsistencies such as ‘’front
		loading’’ and rate distortions of items which may be subject to
		variations.</p>
	<h3>Contract Documentation</h3>
	<p>Formal sets of legal documents agreed and signed by the Client
		and the Contractor with the detailed scope, the quality, the program,
		the contract conditions, and the contract sum. The Form of Contract
		details the obligations of each party during the construction period
		in respect of procedures, responsibilities, rules and regulations and
		any other matters related to the execution of the works. A detailed,
		thorough, well-constructed set of Contract Documents is essential to
		ensure that both parties are fully aware of the other party’s
		obligations and are adequately protected should problems arise during
		the construction period or during the period after completion.</p>
	<h3>Interim Valuation</h3>
	<p>The regular (typically monthly) assessment of the progress of
		the construction works compared to program with an assessment of
		materials stored on site including the costs of any approved
		variations resulting in a recommendation for a payment for the
		Contractor from the Employer in accordance with the Conditions of
		Contract. The amount certified is tracked against the cash flow
		forecast as a guide to establish progress against program.</p>
	<h3>Cost Reports</h3>
	<p>The regular detailed assessment of the cost of the project to
		date, summary of any variations instructed or anticipated, adjustment
		of Provisional Sums and assessment of the likelihood of any potential
		Contractual Claims and summaries of payments made to date and updated
		cash flow forecasts. The cost report is a vital tool for anticipating
		the estimated final cost of the construction works so that the Client
		is fully informed of the anticipated out-turn costs of the project at
		all times.</p>
	<h3>Settlement of Final Accounts</h3>
	<p>It covers final settlement of the contractor account, agreement
		of all variations and claims, recommendation to the client and
		drafting all documentation to close the contract.</p>
	<h3>Change Control Management</h3>
	<p>The procedure for the approval of any changes to the project
		from either the Client, Design Team or Contractor, so that the time,
		cost and quality implications of any change can be thoroughly reviewed
		and estimated so that the Client can make informed and educated about
		the impact of the change to the completion of the project</p>
	<h3>Cost Modelling</h3>
	<p>High level, early stage, elemental analysis of the estimated
		construction cost of a building which is based on cost data
		benchmarked from other similar completed buildings which provides the
		Client and the Design Team a platform for understanding the ‘’cost
		drivers’’ of the project.</p>
	<h3>Cost Data Analysis</h3>
	<p>The comprehensive and detailed analysis of final construction
		costs of similar completed buildings to allow comparison of elements
		of the actual costs to serve as a guide of the design of the new
		project. The key to benchmarking is consistency and setting the
		parameters to ensure consistency in approach that every element of
		each building is analysed in exactly the same way. This enables the
		Client and the Design Team to be able to make informed and educated
		decisions as to the design and cost of a building when compared to
		other similar completed projects.</p>
